# Combining Measurement Sets from Multiple Executions 

# If you have multiple executions, you will want to combine the
# scheduling blocks into a single ms using concat for ease of imaging
# and self-calibration. Each execution of the scheduling block will
# generate multiple spectral windows with different sky frequencies,
# but the same rest frequency, due to the motion of the Earth. Thus,
# the resulting concatentated file will contain n spws, where n is
# (#original science spws) x (number executions).  In other words, the
# multiple spws associated with a single rest frequency will not be
# regridded to a single spectral window in the ms.

# a single spectral window during cleaning or using the cvel
# command. The NA imaging team strongly recommends the first option,
# unless the lines shift too much between executions to identify an
# common channel range for continuum subtraction. The code below uses
# cvel to regrid multiple spws associated with a single rest frequency
# into a single spw. You will want to use the same regridding
# parameters later when you clean to avoid clean regridding the image

# The commands below serve as a guide to best practices for imaging
# ALMA data. It does not replace careful thought on your part while
# imaging the data. You can remove or modify sections as necessary
# depending on your particular imaging case (e.g., no
# self-calibration, continuum only.) Please read the NA Imaging Guide
# (https://staff.nrao.edu/wiki/bin/view/NAASC/NAImagingScripts) for
# more information.

# Before imaging, you should use the commands the first section of
# this script to prep the data for imaging.  The commands in both
# sections should be able to be run as as standard Python
# script. However, the cleaning in this script is done interactively
# making the final product somewhat dependent on the individual doing
# the clean -- please clean conservatively (i.e., don't box every
# possible source). The final data products are the cleaned images
# (*.image), the primary beam corrected images (*.pbcor), and the
# primary beams (*.flux). These images should be converted to fits at
# the end of the script (see example at the end of this file).

# This script (and the associated guide) are under active
# development. Please contact Amanda Kepley (akepley@nrao.edu) if you
# have any suggested changes or find any bugs that are almost
# certainly there.

##################################################
# Create an Averaged Continuum MS

# Continuum images can be sped up considerably by averaging the data
# together to reduce overall volume.  Since the sensitivity of a
# continuum image depends on its bandwidth, continuum images are
# typically made by including as much bandwidth as possible in the
# data while excluding any line emission. The following plotms command
# pages through the spectral windows in a project allowing you to
# identify channel ranges within spectral windows that do not include
# *strong* line emission. You will form a continuum image by averaging
# the line-free spws and/or channel ranges within spws. In most cases,
# you will not need to create an image to select line channels,
# although you can suggest this to the PI as a possible path for
# future exploration in the README file for cases where there is
# wide-spread line emission.

# For a project with continuum target sensitivities, it is worth
# checking the OT to see what continuum bandwidth the PI was
# anticipating. In many cases, the continuum-only windows will be
# specified in the OT, in general these have the broadest bandwidths
# (~2GHz) with a small number of channels (128).  However, other
# windows may be combined with these designated continuum windows to
# increase the continuum sensitivity. In general, it is not necessary
# to include narrow spectral windows (<250MHz) in the continuum image.

finalvis='calibrated_final.ms' # This is your output ms from the data
                               # preparation script.

       iteraxis='spw' )

# Image Parameters

# You're now ready to image. Review the science goals in the OT and
# set the relevant imaging parameters below. 

# source parameters
# ------------------

field='0' # science field(s). For a mosaic, select all mosaic fields. DO NOT LEAVE BLANK ('') OR YOU WILL TRIGGER A BUG IN CLEAN THAT WILL PUT THE WRONG COORDINATE SYSTEM ON YOUR FINAL IMAGE.
# imagermode='csclean' # uncomment if single field
# imagermode='mosaic' # uncomment if mosaic
# phasecenter=3 # uncomment and set to field number for phase
                # center. Note lack of ''.  Use the weblog to
                # determine which pointing to use. Remember that the
                # field ids for each pointing will be re-numbered
                # after your initial split. You can also specify the
                # phase center using coordinates, e.g.,
                # phasecenter='J2000 19h30m00 -40d00m00'

# image parameters.
# ----------------

# Generally, you want 5-8 cells (i.e., pixels) across the narrowest
# part of the beam. You can estimate the beam size using the following
# equation: 206265.0/(longest baseline in wavelengths).  To determine
# the longest baseline, use plotms with xaxis='uvwave' and
# yaxis='amp'. Divide the estimated beam size by five to eight to get
# your cell size. It's better to error on the side of slightly too
# many cells per beam than too few. Once you have made an image,
# please re-assess the cell size based on the beam of the image.

# To determine the image size (i.e., the imsize parameter), first you
# need to figure out whether the ms is a mosaic by either looking out
# the output from listobs or checking the spatial setup in the OT. For
# single fields, an imsize equal to the size of the primary beam is
# usually sufficient. The ALMA 12m primary beam in arcsec scales as
# 6300 / nu[GHz] and the ALMA 7m primary beam in arcsec scales as
# 10608 / nu[GHz], where nu[GHz] is the sky frequency. However, if
# there is significant point source and/or extended emission beyond
# the edges of your initial images, you should increase the imsize to
# incorporate more emission. For mosaics, you can get the imsize from
# the spatial tab of the OT. The parameters "p length" and "q length"
# specify the dimensions of the mosaic. If you're imaging a mosaic,
# pad the imsize substantially to avoid artifacts.

cell='1arcsec' # cell size for imaging.

outframe='bary' # velocity reference frame. See science goals.
veltype='radio' # velocity type. See note below.
restfreq='115.27120GHz' # Typically the rest frequency of the line of
                        # interest. If the source has a significant
                        # redshift (z>0.2), use the observed sky
                        # frequency (nu_rest/(1+z)) instead of the
                        # rest frequency of the
                        # line.

# spw='1' # uncomment and replace with appropriate spw if necessary.

# To specify a spws from multiple executions that had not been regridded using cvel, use
#       import numpy as np
#       spw = str.join(',',map(str,np.arange(0,n,nspw)))
#
# where n is the total number of windows x executions and nspw is the
# number of spectral windows per execution. Note that the spectral
# windows need to have the same order in all data sets for this code
# to work. Add a constant offset (i.e., +1,+2,+3) to the array
# generated by np.arange to get the other sets of windows.

# Note on veltype: We recommend keeping veltype set to radio,
# regardless of the velocity frame listed the object in the OT. If the
# sensitivity is defined using a velocity width, then the 'radio'
# definition of the velocity frame is used regardless of the velocity
# definition in the "source parameters" tab of the OT.
